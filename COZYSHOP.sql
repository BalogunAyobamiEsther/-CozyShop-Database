					/*PROJECT OVERVIEW*/
 /*
As part of your final project, you are tasked with designing and building a 
relational database for CozyShop, a small business that sells handmade booties. 
You will model the business requirements into tables, create an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram), 
build the database using SQL, insert sample data, and run analytical queries to extract insights.
Run queries to generate insights that help CozyShop grow*/

					/* QUESTION  */
/*I wants you to track information on his 
(1) customers (first name, last name, email), 
(2) employees (first name, last name, start date, position held), 
(3) products, 
(4) purchases customers make (which customer, when it was purchased, for how much money). 
Think about how many tables you should create. Which data goes in which tables? 
How should the tables relate to one another?
-- Q1. How many tables will you create, and what will each table represent?
-- Q2. Which columns will belong to each table?
-- Q3. What are the appropriate data types for each column?
-- Q4. Which columns will be primary keys and foreign keys?
-- Q5. Which columns should have UNIQUE or NOT NULL constraints?

*/

/*Given the database design you came up with, 
use Workbench to create an EER diagram of the database. 
Include things like primary keys and foreign keys, and anything
else you think you should have in the tables. 
Make sure to use reasonable data types for each column.*/

/*Create a schema called CozyShop. 
Within that schema, create the tables that you have diagramed out.
 Make sure they relate to each other, and that they have the same reasonable 
 data types you selected previously*/
 
 /*Add any constraints you think your tables’ columns should have. 
 Think through which columns need to be unique, which ones are allowed to have NULL values, 
 etc.*/
 
 /*Insert at least 40 records of data into each table. The exact values do not matter,
 so feel free to make them up. 
 Just make sure that the data you insert makes sense, and that the tables tie together.*/
 
/* QUESTION 2 */
					-- Data Querying & Analysis--
 
 /*Instructions: Write SQL queries to answer the following business questions. 
 Each query should be tested and return correct results based on your sample data.*/

-- Q8. Display the full list of purchases showing:
--      - Customer full name
--      - Product name
